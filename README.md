# Community SOS Welfare System
Topic of this project represents the solutions for a handful of persisting issues concerning
humanity and the environment. Our group aimed to offer HCI ideas related to the SDG 1 (No Poverty)
of our choice. We also hope our development of user-friendly apps can contribute to help people
in need. In shaa Allah.
